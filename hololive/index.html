                    The name Hololive was initially used for Cover's 3D stream distribution app, launched in December 2017, and later its female VTuber agency, whose first generation debuted from May to June 2018.

                    A VTuber (ブイチューバー, buichūbā), or virtual YouTuber (Japanese: バーチャルユーチューバー, Hepburn: bācharu yūchūbā), is an online entertainer who uses a virtual avatar generated using computer graphics and real-time motion capture software or technology. A digital trend that originated in Japan in the mid-2010s and, since the early 2020s, has become an international online phenomenon,[1] a majority of VTubers are English and Japanese-speaking YouTubers or live streamers who use anime-inspired avatar designs. By 2020, there were more than 10,000 active VTubers.[2] Although the term alludes to the video platform YouTube, virtual YouTubers also appear on platforms including Niconico, Twitch and Bilibili.
