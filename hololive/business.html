				<p>August 2017 – 30 million yen (US$280,000) in seed funding from venture capital firms Mizuho Capital, TLM, and angel investors</p>
				<p>June 2018 – 200 million yen (US$1.9 million) in a Series A round from GREE Ventures, OLM Ventures, and Mizuho Capital</p>				
				<p>May 2020 – 700 million yen (US$6.6 million) from various sources, including Hakuhodo DY Ventures and SMBC Venture Capital</p>
				<p>Many Hololive streamers work full-time, while others stream as a side job.  Talent Kiryu Coco had earned approximately 85 million yen (US$810,000) through YouTube's Super Chat donation system as of August 2020, making her the site's all-time top Super Chat earner, according to data collection site Playboard.
