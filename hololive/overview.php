				<h2>Fun Facts</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>The name Hololive was initially used for Cover's 3D stream distribution app, launched in December 2017, and later its female VTuber agency, whose first generation debuted from May to June 2018.</li>
					<li>In December 2019, this Hololive branch was merged with Cover's male Holostars agency and INoNaKa (INNK) Music label to form a unified "Hololive Production" brand. In 2019 and 2020, the agency debuted three overseas branches: Hololive China (since disbanded), Hololive Indonesia, and Hololive English.</li>
