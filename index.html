			<h4>Pekobot-Invasion</h4>

			<img src="images/pekobot.gif" alt="Pekobot Invasion gif">

			<p>A personal project that I've started to learn a bit more with Unity. I'm a computer scientist, not a game designer/developer. Although I've always wanted to develop and design games, my field does not related technologies.
			So why not learn about it myself as opposed to pay money for a class?</p>
			<p>In this project, my end-goal is to recreate the classic game of Asteroids. </p>
