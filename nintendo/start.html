        <h1>Nintendo</h1>
        <p>Nintendo Co., Ltd.[b] is a Japanese multinational consumer electronics and video game company headquartered in Kyoto, Japan. The company was founded in 1889 as Nintendo Karuta[c] by craftsman Fusajiro Yamauchi and originally produced handmade hanafuda playing cards. After venturing into various lines of business during the 1960s and acquiring a legal status as a public company under the current company name, Nintendo distributed its first video game console, the Color TV-Game, in 1977. It gained international recognition with the release of Donkey Kong in 1981 and the Nintendo Entertainment System and Super Mario Bros. in 1985.</p>
        <p>Since then, Nintendo has produced some of the most successful consoles in the video game industry, such as the Game Boy, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, the Nintendo DS, the Wii, and the Nintendo Switch. It has created numerous major franchises, including Mario, Donkey Kong, The Legend of Zelda, Pokémon, Kirby, Metroid, Fire Emblem, Animal Crossing, Splatoon, Star Fox, Xenoblade Chronicles, and Super Smash Bros. The character of Mario is internationally recognisable, and serves as the company's mascot.</p>
        <p>Nintendo has multiple subsidiaries in Japan and abroad, in addition to business partners such as The Pokémon Company and HAL Laboratory. Nintendo and its staff has received awards including Emmy Awards for Technology & Engineering, Game Awards, Game Developers Choice Awards and British Academy Games Awards. It is one of the wealthiest and most valuable companies in the Japanese market.</p>

        <h2>Debate</h2>
        <h3>#FreeSmash</h3>
        <p>The Big House is one of the most well-known Super Smash Bros Melee tournaments in the world. In October 2020, they announced that that year’s event (in December) would have to take place online.</p>
        <p>Going online was only possible thanks to Slippi Online, a custom emulator that allows you to play Melee (and other old Nintendo titles) with other people, even if you aren’t sitting right next to each other.</p>
        <p>Melee fans were relieved that the global crisis didn’t cancel their beloved event—that is, until The Big House received a cease-and-desist from Nintendo for using “illegally copied versions” of Melee.</p>

        <p>It wasn’t long until this move sparked the #FreeMelee and #FreeSmash hashtags that trended worldwide on social media. This wasn’t first time Nintendo shut down an event like this, but it was the last straw for a lot of fans of the Smash franchise.</p>
        <p>You have to remember: Super Smash Bros Melee is 20 years old now, and Nintendo has made no move to port it to newer consoles. There’s no other legal way to play the game over the internet.</p>
        <p>Without a viable alternative method, many fans feel like this was an unnecessarily harsh move with no real benefit for Nintendo—especially as the cease-and-desist came just weeks before the event.</p>

        <p>In 1959, Nintendo contracted with Walt Disney to incorporate his company's animated characters into the cards.[24] Nintendo also developed a distribution system that allowed it to offer its products in toy stores.[19] By 1961, the company had sold more than 1.5 million card packs and held a high market share, for which it relied on televised advertising campaigns.</p>

        <h3>Mario Movie</h3>
        <p>On Sept. 23, Nintendo announced via its online presentation Nintendo Direct that it will be releasing a new animated Super Mario movie in 2022 with Illumination Studios. The cast includes “The Queen’s Gambit” star Anya Taylor-Joy as Princess Peach, Seth Rogen as Donkey Kong, and comedian Keegan-Michael Key as Toad. Who gets to play the lead role of Mario? Perhaps, Danny Devito — with his scratchy New Jersey Italian accent — snatched the role? Or maybe the honor is bestowed upon comedian T.J. Miller, who led the equally star-studded ensemble of the “The Emoji Movie?” These were just a few of the possibilities floating around the internet. Unfortunately for Nintendo pundits, however, the answer is Chris Pratt. To be fair, Pratt is an excellent actor, garnering much love from fans for his roles as Star-Lord in “Guardians of the Galaxy” and Emmet in “The Lego Movie.” However, he seems out of place in the ostensibly comedy-heavy cast given his recent action roles. Alongside personalities such as Rogen, Jack Black, and Charlie Day, Pratt possesses the least comedic presence, which should not be the case for the lead role in any star-studded movie. He’s not even Italian. Even Ryan Reynolds, frankly, would have made a better choice.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Nintendo was founded as Nintendo Karuta[d] on 23 September 1889[7] by craftsman Fusajiro Yamauchi in Shimogyō-ku, Kyoto, Japan, to produce and distribute hanafuda (花札, "flower cards"),[1][4][8] a type of traditional Japanese playing card. The name 'Nintendo' is commonly assumed to mean "leave luck to heaven",[9][8] but the assumption lacks historical validation; it can alternatively be translated as "the temple of free hanafuda".[10] With the increase of the cards' popularity, Yamauchi hired assistants to mass-produce to satisfy the demand.[11] Even with a favorable start, the company faced financial struggle due to operating in a niche market, the slow and expensive manufacturing process, high product price, alongside long durability of the cards, which impacted sales due to the low replacement rate.[12] As a solution, Nintendo produced a cheaper and lower-quality line of playing cards, Tengu, while also conducting product offerings in other cities such as Osaka, where card game profits were high. In addition, local merchants were interested in the prospect of a continuous renewal of decks, thus avoiding the suspicions that reusing cards would generate.[13]</p>
        <p>According to data from Nintendo, the company's first western-style card deck was put on the market in 1902,[3] although other documents postpone the date to 1907, shortly after the Russo-Japanese War.[14] The war created considerable difficulties for companies in the leisure sector, which were subject to new levies such as the Karuta Zei ("playing cards tax").[15] Nintendo subsisted and, in 1907, entered into an agreement with Nihon Senbai—later known as the Japan Tobacco—to market its cards to various cigarette stores throughout the country.[16] A promotional calendar distributed by Nintendo from the Taishō era dated to 1915 was found, indicating that the company was named 'Yamauchi Nintendo', and used the Marufuku Nintendo Co. brand for its playing cards.[17]</p>
        <p>Japanese culture stipulated that for Nintendo Koppai to continue as a family business after Yamauchi's retirement, Yamauchi had to adopt his son-in-law so that he could take over the business. As a result, Sekiryo Kaneda adopted the Yamauchi surname in 1907 and became the second president of Nintendo Koppai in 1929. By that time, Nintendo Koppai was the largest card game company in Japan.[18]</p>

        <h3>1889-1969</h3>
        <p>Nintendo was founded as Nintendo Karuta[d] on 23 September 1889[7] by craftsman Fusajiro Yamauchi in Shimogyō-ku, Kyoto, Japan, to produce and distribute hanafuda (花札, "flower cards"),[1][4][8] a type of traditional Japanese playing card. With the increase of the cards' popularity, Yamauchi hired assistants to mass-produce to satisfy the demand.</p>

As a result, Sekiryo Kaneda adopted the Yamauchi surname in 1907 and became the second president of Nintendo Koppai in 1929. By that time, Nintendo Koppai was the largest card game company in Japan.</p>

        <h3>1929-1968</h3>
        <p>In 1933, Sekiryo Kaneda established the company as a general partnership titled Yamauchi Nintendo & Co. Ltd.</p>
        <p>In 1950, due to Sekiryo's deteriorating health,[23] Hiroshi assumed the presidency of Nintendo. His first actions involved several important changes in the operation of the company: in 1951, he changed the company name to Nintendo Playing Card Co. Ltd.,[3] while the Marufuku Company adopted the name 'Nintendo Karuta Co. Ltd.'</p>
        <p>In 1952, he centralized the production of cards in the Kyoto factories,[3] which led to the expansion of the offices.[25] The company's new line of plastic cards enjoyed considerable success in Japan.</p>
        <p>In 1959, Nintendo contracted with Walt Disney to incorporate his company's animated characters into the cards.[24] Nintendo also developed a distribution system that allowed it to offer its products in toy stores.</p>
        <p>When Disney card sales began to show signs of exhaustion, Nintendo realized that it had no real alternative with which to alleviate the situation.[28] After the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, Nintendo's stock price plummeted to its lowest recorded level of ¥60.[29][30]</p>
        <p>Between 1963 and 1968, Yamauchi invested in several business lines for Nintendo that were far from its traditional market and, for the most part, were unsuccessful.[31] Among these ventures were packages of instant rice, a chain of love hotels, and a taxi service named 'Daiya'.</p>

        <h3>1973–1978</h3>
        <p>For Nintendo, the next big thing meant toys and electronic games. Arcades in the 1970s were the hip places to be.</p>
        <p>In 1974, Nintendo released Wild Gunman, a skeet shooting simulator consisting of a 16 mm image projector with a sensor that detects a beam from the player's light gun. Both the Laser Clay Shooting System and Wild Gunman were successfully exported to Europe and North America.</p>
        <p>The subsidiary Nintendo Leisure System Co., Ltd., which developed these products, was closed as a result of the economic impact dealt by the oil crisis.</p>
        
        <h3>1979–1987: Game & Watch, arcade games, and Nintendo Entertainment System</h3>
        <p>Two key events in Nintendo's history occurred in 1979: its American subsidiary was opened in New York City, and a new department focused on arcade game development was created. In 1980, one of the first handheld video game systems, the Game & Watch, was created by Yokoi from the technology used in portable calculators.</p>
        <p>Development of Donkey Kong, the game vonsisting of a single premise: Jumpman, who was a carpenter, needed to rescue his girlfriend, Pauline, from his "crazed" pet gorilla, who'd kidnapped her.</p>

        <p>In the early 1980s, several video game consoles proliferated in the United States, as well as low-quality games produced by third-party developers,[54] which oversaturated the market and led to the video game crash of 1983.</p>
        <p>After years of selling its games made for devices designed by other companies, Nintendo released its own game console, the Nintendo Entertainment System, worldwide in 1985, designed to combat market saturation.</p>

        <p>In 1985, Mario got his big break. Miyamoto reinvented "Donkey Kong" for the Nintendo Entertainment System and made Mario the star.</p>
