                        The Big House is one of the most well-known Super Smash Bros Melee tournaments in the world. In October 2020, they announced 
                        that that year’s event (in December) would have to take place online. Going online was only possible thanks to Slippi 
                        Online, a custom emulator that allows you to play Melee (and other old Nintendo titles) with other people, even if you aren’t 
                        sitting right next to each other.Melee fans were relieved that the global crisis didn’t cancel their beloved event—that is, 
                        until The Big House received a cease-and-desist from Nintendo for using “illegally copied versions” of Melee. It wasn’t 
                        long until this move sparked the #FreeMelee and #FreeSmash hashtags that trended worldwide on social media. This wasn’t 
                        first time Nintendo shut down an event like this, but it was the last straw for a lot of fans of the Smash franchise. You 
                        have to remember: Super Smash Bros Melee is 20 years old now, and Nintendo has made no move to port it to newer consoles. 
                        There’s no other legal way to play the game over the internet. Without a viable alternative method, many fans feel like 
                        this was an unnecessarily harsh move with no real benefit for Nintendo—especially as the cease-and-desist came just weeks 
                        before the event.

                    <h2>Mario Movie</h2>

                        On Sept. 23, Nintendo announced via its online presentation Nintendo Direct that it will be releasing a new animated Super 
                        Mario movie in 2022 with Illumination Studios. The cast includes “The Queen’s Gambit” star Anya Taylor-Joy as Princess 
                        Peach, Seth Rogen as Donkey Kong, and comedian Keegan-Michael Key as Toad. Who gets to play the lead role of Mario? Perhaps, 
                        Danny Devito — with his scratchy New Jersey Italian accent — snatched the role? Or maybe the honor is bestowed upon comedian 
                        T.J. Miller, who led the equally star-studded ensemble of the “The Emoji Movie?” These were just a few of the possibilities 
                        floating around the internet. Unfortunately for Nintendo pundits, however, the answer is Chris Pratt. To be fair, Pratt is 
                        an excellent actor, garnering much love from fans for his roles as Star-Lord in “Guardians of the Galaxy” and Emmet in “The 
                        Lego Movie.” However, he seems out of place in the ostensibly comedy-heavy cast given his recent action roles. Alongside 
                        personalities such as Rogen, Jack Black, and Charlie Day, Pratt possesses the least comedic presence, which should not be 
                        the case for the lead role in any star-studded movie. He’s not even Italian. Even Ryan Reynolds, frankly, would have made a 
                        better choice.
