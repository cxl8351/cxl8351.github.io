                        Nintendo was founded as Nintendo Karuta[d] on 23 September 1889[7] by craftsman Fusajiro Yamauchi in Shimogyō-ku, 
                        Kyoto, Japan, to produce and distribute hanafuda (花札, "flower cards"),[1][4][8] a type of traditional Japanese 
                        playing card. The name 'Nintendo' is commonly assumed to mean "leave luck to heaven",[9][8] but the assumption lacks 
                        historical validation; it can alternatively be translated as "the temple of free hanafuda".[10] With the increase of 
                        the cards' popularity, Yamauchi hired assistants to mass-produce to satisfy the demand.[11] Even with a favorable 
                        start, the company faced financial struggle due to operating in a niche market, the slow and expensive manufacturing 
                        process, high product price, alongside long durability of the cards, which impacted sales due to the low replacement 
                        rate.[12] As a solution, Nintendo produced a cheaper and lower-quality line of playing cards, Tengu, while also 
                        conducting product offerings in other cities such as Osaka, where card game profits were high. In addition, local 
                        merchants were interested in the prospect of a continuous renewal of decks, thus avoiding the suspicions that reusing 
                        cards would generate.[13]

                        According to data from Nintendo, the company's first western-style card deck was put on the market in 1902,[3] although 
                        other documents postpone the date to 1907, shortly after the Russo-Japanese War.[14] The war created considerable 
                        difficulties for companies in the leisure sector, which were subject to new levies such as the Karuta Zei ("playing 
                        cards tax").[15] Nintendo subsisted and, in 1907, entered into an agreement with Nihon Senbai—later known as the Japan 
                        Tobacco—to market its cards to various cigarette stores throughout the country.[16] A promotional calendar distributed 
                        by Nintendo from the Taishō era dated to 1915 was found, indicating that the company was named 'Yamauchi Nintendo', 
                        and used the Marufuku Nintendo Co. brand for its playing cards.[17]

                        Japanese culture stipulated that for Nintendo Koppai to continue as a family business after Yamauchi's retirement, 
                        Yamauchi had to adopt his son-in-law so that he could take over the business. As a result, Sekiryo Kaneda adopted 
                        the Yamauchi surname in 1907 and became the second president of Nintendo Koppai in 1929. By that time, Nintendo Koppai 
                        was the largest card game company in Japan.[18]
